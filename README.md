# ðŸ§  KNN Classification on Breast Cancer Dataset

This project demonstrates a complete **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification pipeline using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**, included in `scikit-learn`. It covers the essential steps in a machine learning workflow:

- **Data loading and exploration**
- **Preprocessing and feature scaling**
- **Model training and evaluation**
- **Hyperparameter tuning**
- **Meaningful visualizations** (class distribution, PCA projection, confusion matrix, etc.)

The goal is to predict whether a tumor is **malignant (0)** or **benign (1)** based on features like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

This project is ideal for learners who want to practice a mid-level supervised classification task with **KNN** and get familiar with common ML tools such as `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.
